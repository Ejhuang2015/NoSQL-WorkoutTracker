![GNU License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GNU-blue)

This project is a practice on using a NoSQL database, in this case MongoDB's cloud service Atlas. With a prebuilt front-end, this project allows users to enter in their workout to keep track of their daily exercise. Users can see their weekly progress through the dashboard which provides two charts that tracks the user's cardio and resistence training.
